# EduManage Product UX Audit

## Executive Summary

EduManage is being positioned as an operating system for modern schools, not a generic admin dashboard. The product must win trust quickly because it handles sensitive student, parent, academic and financial data.

Primary product promise:

> Help schools run academics, finance, attendance, communication and parent engagement from one reliable operating system.

## Highest-Risk UX Problems Identified

### 1. Trust gap before signup

Users deciding whether to trust a school SaaS need evidence of security, support, privacy, data ownership and operational reliability before they enter credentials.

**Fix implemented:** landing page now includes security, role-based access, deployment readiness, support/legal routes and clear product positioning.

### 2. Cognitive overload in dashboards

School owners, principals, teachers, accountants, parents and students have different jobs. A single generic dashboard increases confusion.

**Fix implemented:** product architecture separates command center, teacher desk, finance, results, portals, communications and trust center.

### 3. Unclear activation path

A new school needs to know what to do first: create workspace, add classes, invite staff, import students, configure fees, publish portal.

**Fix implemented:** launch center, onboarding center and deployment guide create a clearer activation path.

### 4. Lack of production confidence

Real buyers ask: Is this secure? Can it scale? Can I get support? Is there a deployment process?

**Fix implemented:** security page, trust center, audit trail, deployment/testing docs, Supabase database control room and support pages.
